fileobj = open(filename,mode)

    fileobj - file object returned by open()
    filename - String name of the file
    mode - string indicating the file's type and what we want to perform

First Letter of mode indicates the operation :

    r means read
    w means write. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If already exists it will be over-written
    x means write, but only if file doesn't exist
    a means append (write after the end) if the file exists.

Second letter of mode is file's type:

    t (or nothing) means text
    b means binary

close the file once write is complete. fileobj.close()
